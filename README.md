# ZoomBot
A ZoomBot that will connect to your classes for you!

Welcome to the zoom bot.

Some browsers may experience problems with the program like Mozilla Firefox.
Google Chrome, Edge and Opera have been tested and are PREFERED to use as DEFAULT browsers in order to connect to the meeting.

Using the Schedule.csv file, you can add your class's information with the following order: Day of class, Class starting time, Zoom link to connect.
You have to add all of these information by commas ( , ) seperating them.
If you want to add a new class you simply go to a new line and repeat the proccess.

The program will connect to the zoom meeting 5 minutes before the start of the class.
If you open the program within one (1) hour of class starting time you will be connected immediately.
Running the program one (1) hour past the class's start time will result in the program to ignore it and start the count down to the next class of the day in the schedule if this indeed exists.

If you have NOT checked the box to open the zoom links immediately the bot will connect to the meeting by moving your arrow keys. In this time you MUST NOT interfere with the computer at all (15-20 seconds)

Thank you for using the zoom bot, remember to set your default browser to either Google Chrome or Opera.
